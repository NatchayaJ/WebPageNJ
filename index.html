           <h3>Cross-Cultural Expertise:</h3>
           During my bachelor degree at Mahidol University College and as my major was International Business Management, I studied Business Negotiation which is about how to successfully close deals with foreigner clients by understanding the nature of their cultures.
           I also have a chance to be in the training where most participants are a mix of Thais and foreigners, thus we have exchanging the significant issues when working with someone who are from different cultures.

            <h3>Work Experiences:</h3>
            I used to work with an agency company in the E-Commerce area as an Account Executive which had to increase sales by creating campaigns and promotions. After that I was an Online Business Development Executive for a FMCG company which had to plan each project or new product line to be ready to launch via online platform, including creating campaigns and promotions.
